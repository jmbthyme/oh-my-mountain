# Contributing to Mountain Comparison App

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Mountain Comparison App! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/oh-my-mountain.git
   cd oh-my-mountain
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a branch for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Code Standards

- **TypeScript**: All new code should be written in TypeScript
- **ESLint**: Follow the existing ESLint configuration
- **Prettier**: Code is automatically formatted with Prettier
- **Testing**: Write tests for new components and utilities

### Commit Messages

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat: add new mountain selection feature`
- `fix: resolve triangle scaling issue`
- `docs: update README with deployment info`
- `test: add tests for MountainTriangle component`

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Place test files in `src/__tests__/` directory
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both happy path and error cases
- Aim for good test coverage

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests once
npm run test:run

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test

# Run specific test file
npm run test -- MountainTriangle.test.tsx
```

## Component Guidelines

### Component Structure

```typescript
// ComponentName.tsx
import React from 'react';
import './ComponentName.css';

interface ComponentNameProps {
  // Define props with TypeScript
}

export const ComponentName: React.FC<ComponentNameProps> = ({ 
  // destructure props 
}) => {
  // Component logic
  
  return (
    <div className="component-name">
      {/* JSX content */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Styling

- Use CSS Modules for component-specific styles
- Follow BEM naming convention for CSS classes
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Use semantic HTML elements
